The Memory Game is a simple game, where the user chooses two cards from an 6 x 6 grid to see if they match. A match could be same image, number, or color. If the user chooses two cards that do not match, the card will flip back down to their original places for the user to pick agian. If they do match, the card will be removed from the board game, so the the user may complete it. 

#### Functions of the game: 
  * Randomize the card before playing
